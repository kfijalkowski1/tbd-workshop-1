IMPORTANT ❗ ❗ ❗ Please remember to destroy all the resources after each work session. You can recreate infrastructure by creating new PR and merging it to master.

1. Authors:

   ***enter your group nr***

   ***link to forked repo***
   
2. Follow all steps in README.md.

3. From avaialble Github Actions select and run destroy on main branch.
   
4. Create new git branch and:
    1. Modify tasks-phase1.md file.
    
    2. Create PR from this branch to **YOUR** master and merge it to make new release. 
    
    ***place the screenshot from GA after succesfull application of release***


5. Analyze terraform code. Play with terraform plan, terraform graph to investigate different modules.

    ***describe one selected module and put the output of terraform graph for this module here***
   
6. Reach YARN UI
   
   ***place the command you used for setting up the tunnel, the port and the screenshot of YARN UI here***
   
7. Draw an architecture diagram (e.g. in draw.io) that includes:
    1. Description of the components of service accounts
    2. List of buckets for disposal
    
    ***place your diagram here***

8. Create a new PR and add costs by entering the expected consumption into Infracost
For all the resources of type: `google_artifact_registry`, `google_storage_bucket`, `google_service_networking_connection`
create a sample usage profiles and add it to the Infracost task in CI/CD pipeline. Usage file [example](https://github.com/infracost/infracost/blob/master/infracost-usage-example.yml) 

   ***place the expected consumption you entered here***

   ***place the screenshot from infracost output here***

9. Create a BigQuery dataset and an external table using SQL
    
    ***place the code and output here***
   
    ***why does ORC not require a table schema?***

10. Find and correct the error in spark-job.py

    ***describe the cause and how to find the error***

11. Add support for preemptible/spot instances in a Dataproc cluster

    ***place the link to the modified file and inserted terraform code***
    
12. Triggered Terraform Destroy on Schedule or After PR Merge. Goal: make sure we never forget to clean up resources and burn money.

Add a new GitHub Actions workflow that:
  1. runs terraform destroy -auto-approve
  2. triggers automatically:
   
   a) on a fixed schedule (e.g. every day at 20:00 UTC)
   
   b) when a PR is merged to main containing [CLEANUP] tag in title

Steps:
  1. Create file .github/workflows/auto-destroy.yml
  2. Configure it to authenticate and destroy Terraform resources
  3. Test the trigger (schedule or cleanup-tagged PR)
     
***paste workflow YAML here***

***paste screenshot/log snippet confirming the auto-destroy ran***

***write one sentence why scheduling cleanup helps in this workshop***
